Here are four hypotheses in the origins of life that could be explored with a self-driving laboratory, along with the key equipment and instruments needed, and the experimental protocols that would need to be automated:

**Hypothesis 1: Primordial Soup Hypothesis**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged from a primordial soup of organic molecules that existed on Earth around 4 billion years ago.
* Key equipment and instruments needed:
	+ High-temperature and high-pressure reactors to simulate early Earth conditions
	+ Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the chemical composition of the primordial soup
	+ Fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the presence of biomolecules
	+ Microfluidic devices to simulate the mixing and interaction of molecules
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
	+ Preparation of the primordial soup by mixing and heating a solution of organic compounds
	+ Simulation of early Earth conditions by controlling temperature, pressure, and pH
	+ Analysis of the chemical composition of the primordial soup using GC-MS and fluorescence spectroscopy
	+ Detection of biomolecules and their interactions using microfluidic devices

**Hypothesis 2: Iron-Sulfur World Theory**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged in an iron-sulfur rich environment, where simple iron-sulfur clusters played a central role in the emergence of biomolecules.
* Key equipment and instruments needed:
	+ Anaerobic chambers to simulate the oxygen-free environment of early Earth
	+ Electrochemical cells to simulate the redox reactions that occurred in the iron-sulfur world
	+ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to analyze the structure and composition of iron-sulfur clusters
	+ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate and analyze biomolecules
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
	+ Preparation of the iron-sulfur rich environment by mixing and heating a solution of iron and sulfur compounds
	+ Simulation of redox reactions using electrochemical cells
	+ Analysis of the structure and composition of iron-sulfur clusters using XAS
	+ Detection of biomolecules and their interactions using HPLC

**Hypothesis 3: RNA World Hypothesis**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged from a world where RNA molecules played a central role in the storage and transmission of genetic information.
* Key equipment and instruments needed:
	+ Thermocyclers to simulate the temperature fluctuations that occurred on early Earth
	+ Real-time PCR to detect and quantify RNA molecules
	+ Gel electrophoresis to separate and analyze RNA molecules
	+ Microfluidic devices to simulate the interaction and replication of RNA molecules
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
	+ Preparation of RNA molecules by in vitro transcription
	+ Simulation of temperature fluctuations using thermocyclers
	+ Detection and quantification of RNA molecules using real-time PCR
	+ Analysis of RNA molecules using gel electrophoresis and microfluidic devices

**Hypothesis 4: Deep-Hot Biosphere Hypothesis**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged in the deep, hot biosphere of Earth, where microorganisms thrive in the absence of light and oxygen.
* Key equipment and instruments needed:
	+ High-temperature and high-pressure reactors to simulate the conditions of the deep, hot biosphere
	+ Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the chemical composition of the deep, hot biosphere
	+ Fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the presence of biomolecules
	+ Microfluidic devices to simulate the interaction and replication of microorganisms
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
	+ Preparation of the deep, hot biosphere by mixing and heating a solution of organic compounds
	+ Simulation of the conditions of the deep, hot biosphere using high-temperature and high-pressure reactors
	+ Analysis of the chemical composition of the deep, hot biosphere using GC-MS and fluorescence spectroscopy
	+ Detection of biomolecules and their interactions using microfluidic devices

These hypotheses and experimental protocols can be explored using a self-driving laboratory, which can automate the preparation of samples, simulation of conditions, and analysis of data. The laboratory can also be equipped with machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions about the origins of life.
