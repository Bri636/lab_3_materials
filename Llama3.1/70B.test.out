Here are four hypotheses in the origins of life that could be explored with a self-driving laboratory, along with the key equipment and instruments needed, and the experimental protocols that would need to be automated:

**Hypothesis 1: Primordial Soup Hypothesis**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged from a primordial soup of organic molecules that existed on Earth around 4 billion years ago.

	+ High-temperature and high-pressure reactors to simulate early Earth conditions
	+ Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the chemical composition of the primordial soup
	+ Fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the presence of biomolecules
	+ Microfluidic devices to simulate the mixing and interaction of molecules
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
	+ Preparation of primordial soup solutions with varying compositions and concentrations
	+ Simulation of early Earth conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH) using the reactors
	+ Analysis of the chemical composition of the primordial soup using GC-MS
	+ Detection of biomolecules using fluorescence spectroscopy
	+ Simulation of molecular interactions and mixing using microfluidic devices

**Hypothesis 2: Iron-Sulfur World Theory**

* Hypothesis: Life emerged in an iron-sulfur rich environment, where simple iron-sulfur clusters played a central role in the emergence of biomolecules.
* Key equipment and instruments needed:
	+ Anaerobic chambers to simulate the oxygen-free environment of early Earth

	+ High-temperature and high-pressure reactors to simulate the conditions of the deep, hot biosphere
	+ Microscopy to visualize the growth and behavior of microorganisms
	+ Spectroscopy to study the chemical composition of the deep, hot biosphere
	+ Gas chromatography to analyze the chemical composition of the gases present in the deep, hot biosphere
	+ Microfluidic devices to simulate the interaction and behavior of microorganisms
* Experimental protocols to be automated:
